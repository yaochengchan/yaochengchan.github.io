My primary research interest is Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), specifically about how humans perceive and react to robots that they incidentally encounter in their daily lives, using empirical and mixed-methods. My work has been published in several HRI-related journals and conferences. My research contributes to the fields of HRI, Social Robotics, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I also study the use of eye-tracker in both HRI and HCI studies and explore its potential in HRI studies of public settings.
